Android-Launcher2-Standalone
============================
This is a modified version of the stock android launcher for 4.1 above. I removed all private APIs so it runs as a standalone app. This could be a starting point for anyone who like to build a customized launcher.

### Source
The original code is copied from AOSP launcher2 tag android-4.2.1-r1.2

### Updates
Mar/20/2013 tested on Galaxy Nexus 4.1 and 4.2
